What is Data Mining?
========================================================
- Extracting knowledge from large amounts of data
- Many treat data mining as synonym of Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD)
- Others view it as one of steps in the process of KDD

Data Mining on what kind of data (contd)
=======================================================
- Transactional Databases
- Object-Relational Databases
- Temporal Databases, Sequence Databases, and Time-Series Databases
- Spatial Databases
- Text Databases and Multimedia Databases
- Data Streams

Transactional Databases
=======================================================
- consists of a file where each record represents

Data Mining Functionalities and kinds of patterns
=======================================================
- Data mining tasks can be classified into two categories:
  1. Descriptive: characterize general properties of data in the database
  2. Predictive: perform inference on the current data to make predictions
